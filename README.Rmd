# `{rmsReport}`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{rmsReport}` is to provide a template for the standard RESULTS MONITORING SURVEY Data Collection REPORT.

The main objectives is to avoid duplication of information between the report and the information that is already expected to be gathered and recorded within [UNHCR Internal Data Repository](http://ridl.unhcr.org). RIDL already follow the international standard for metadata. Namely [Data Documentation Initiative](https://ddialliance.org/).

The report pulls data using the API with the [`{riddle}`]() package and use both [`{unhcrdown}`]() and [`{unhcrtheme}`]() to prepopulate the report




## Installation and token authentication 

You can install the development version of `{rmsReport}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("edouard-legoupil/riddle")
pak::pkg_install("unhcr-americas/rmsReport")
```


The `{riddle}` package is used to ensure integration with UNHCR Data Repository](https://ridl.unhcr.org).
It requires you to add your __API token__ and store it for further use. 
The easiest way to do that is to store your API token in your `.Renviron` file which 
is automatically read by R on startup.

You can retrieve your `API TOKEN` in your [user page](https://ridl.unhcr.org/user/).

![api_token_img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edouard-Legoupil/riddle/main/inst/token.png)

To use the package, youâ€™ll need to store your RIDL API token in the `RIDL_API_TOKEN` environment variable. 
The easiest way to do that is by calling `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and adding the line
`RIDL_API_TOKEN=xxxxx` to the file before saving and restarting your R session.



## Example

To build your report, File > New File > Rmarkdown > from template > rmsReport.

You will need to document a few parameters for the report:

 * ridl this is the canonical name for the dataset in RIDL
 * title 

Alternatively you can use the following functions

``` r

```
